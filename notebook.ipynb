I bring together technology, psychology, marketing, and project management to deliver creative, high‑impact solutions. With a broad background that spans software, behavioral insights, and strategic planning, I'm passionate about driving innovation by bridging disciplines. I’m originally from Finland and have carved out a career focused on building alignment between human behavior and tech strategies. I enjoy tackling challenges that require both analytical rigor and empathy—whether that’s designing a campaign or orchestrating a cross‑functional project.  Outside of work I value authentic communication, collaboration, and the occasional creative detour—like exploring new frameworks or diving into psychology research just because it sparks curiosity. I’m always open to connecting, exchanging ideas, or working together to build something great.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\n4259225074 (Mobile)\\njsoI@live.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/\\njoonasisoininen (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nGradio\\nOpenAI API\\nPyPDF\\nLanguages\\nFinnish (Native or Bilingual)\\nSpanish (Limited Working)\\nEnglish (Native or Bilingual)\\nCertifications\\nTechnical Product Management\\nManaging Project Stakeholders\\nStrategic Communication for\\nLeaders\\nBecoming a Product Manager: A\\nComplete Guide\\nAdvanced Prompt Engineering\\nTechniques\\nJoonas Soininen\\nBridging the gap between Tech, Psychology, and Music\\nSammamish, Washington, United States\\nSummary\\nHi i’m Joonas Soininen, I deliver innovative solutions and creative\\nstrategies.
